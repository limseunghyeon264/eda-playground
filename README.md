## Data Source
Dataset obtained from Kaggle Dataset containing world-happiness report.

## Key Findings
- **Insight 1: The average global happiness score remained relatively stable from 2015 to 2024, with minor fluctuations across years.
- **Insight 2: Countries with higher GDP per capita and stronger social support tend to have higher happiness scores.

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn).
- Jupyter Notebook.

## Visualizations
- Yearly trend of happiness scores (2015–2024).
- Comparison of country rankings.
- Correlation heatmap of key numerical variables.
- Distribution of happiness scores.

## Recommendations
- Further analysis should focus on identifying key factors that significantly influence happiness scores.
- Future modeling efforts may include regression or machine learning approaches to predict happiness trends.
- Additional external data sources could be integrated to improve analytical depth.
